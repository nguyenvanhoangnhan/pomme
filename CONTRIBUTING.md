# Contributing

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of _anything_, just ask
or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for
giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be
politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions,
and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

However, for those individuals who want a bit more guidance on the
best way to contribute to the project, read on. This document will cover
what we're looking for. By addressing all the points we're looking for,
it raises the chances we can quickly merge or address your contributions.

## Pull Requests

Thank you for contributing! Here you'll find information on what to include in
your Pull Request to ensure it is accepted quickly.

 * For pull requests that follow the guidelines, we expect to be able to review
   and merge very quickly.
 * Pull requests that don't follow the guidelines will be annotated with what
   they're missing. A team member may be able to swing around
   and help finish up the work, but these PRs will generally hang out much
   longer until they can be completed and merged.

### Pull Request Lifecycle

1. You are welcome to submit your pull request for commentary or review before
   it is fully completed. Please add the defined label of your pull request with
   `wip` to indicate this (since our organization subscription plan does not
   support draft pull request feature). It's also a good idea to include
   specific questions or items you'd like feedback on.

2. Whenever you push your changes to your branch, an Github Action will be
   triggered to test linters related charts. The result of the build will be be visible
   in the "Checks" section of the PR.

3. Once you believe your pull request is ready to be merged, you can remove any
   `wip` label and add the `Need review` label and assigned team members will perform code review.

4. At least one of the assigned team members will look over your contribution and
   either provide comments letting you know if there is anything left to do. We
   do our best to provide feedback in a timely manner, but it may take some
   time for us to respond.

5. Once all outstanding comments have been addressed, your contribution will be
   able to merge!

6. In rare cases, we might decide that a PR should be closed. We'll make sure
   to provide clear reasoning when this happens.
